Problem Statement:

Is gender independent of education level? A random sample of 395 people were
surveyed and each person was asked to report the highest education level they
obtained. The data that resulted from the survey is summarized in the following table:

High School Bachelors Masters Ph.d. Total
Female 60 54 46 41 201
Male 40 44 53 57 194
Total 100 98 99 98 395

Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In
other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender
of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?

Solution:

Null Hypothesis
    The two categorical variables are independent 

Alternative Hypothesis
    The two categorical variables are dependent 

Chi-Square Test Statistic
    χ2=∑(O−E)2/E
    where O represents the observed frequency. E is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis and computed by:

     
   E=(row total×column total)/sample size
    
We will compare the value of the test statistic to the critical value of χ2α with degree of freedom = (r - 1) (c - 1), and reject the null hypothesis if χ2>χ2α.
